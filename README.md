Description: A program that logs and records keystrokes in a text file for analysis.

Explanation: This keylogger listens for keystrokes in real-time, captures each one, and appends it to a log file. It keeps track of both character keys and special keys (e.g., Esc) until the program is stopped, making it useful for monitoring keyboard input.

1)Install the pynput library using pip:
pip install pynput

2)Run the program:
python keylogger.py

3)The program will record keystrokes and save them to a file called key_log.txt.
Note:
The program will stop logging when the Esc key is pressed.

AN EXAMPLE .txt file has been uploaded in the repository.
